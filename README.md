# Barbershop
An app that allowes you to make an appointment with your barber.

This is my second ever Python application. I could have made this in Django or something with a real database but I chose to make it using a faux-database that is actually just a python file that created some Instances of the Classes I supplied. It was very fun to make and I'll keep working on other stuff.
